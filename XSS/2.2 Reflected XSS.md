  
- Reflected XSS vulnerabilities 
	happen when user input is returned to the user without being stored in a database. 
	The application takes in user input, processes it server and immediately returns it to the user

- **example** If the search functionality displays any user-submitted search string on the results page, a search term like the following would cause a script to become embedded on the results page and executed by the browser:
	https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS by El5ateb');</script>

- If an attacker can trick victims into visiting this URL
	the payload will become embedded in their version of the page, it is making the victimâ€™s browser run whatever code the attacker would like. Unlike stored XSS, which allows attackers to execute code on anyone who accesses their stored resources
###### reflected XSS enables attackers to execute code on the browsers of victims who click their malicious links.
